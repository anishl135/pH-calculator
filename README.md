# pH-calculator
## Biochemistry Tool
This Python application provides a simple GUI interface for calculating the pH of a solution based on the concentration of H+ ions in the solution. It's a handy tool for biochemistry calculations.

H## ow to Use
1. Download the Zip and extract the files
2. Run the `pH.py` script.
3. A graphical user interface (GUI) window will open.
4. In the "Enter H+ Concentration (mol/L):" field, input the concentration of H+ ions in the solution in mol/L (molarity).
5. Click the "Calculate pH" button.
6. The calculated pH value will be displayed below.
7. You can clear the input field and result by clicking the "Clear" button.
   
Note: Ensure that you enter a valid numeric concentration for accurate pH calculation and write power in the form of e.

Instead of `1 x 10^7`, write `1e7`
## equirements
This application is built using Python and the `Tkinter` library for the GUI. You need to have Python installed on your system to run this script.

## How It Works
The application calculates pH using the formula: `pH = -log10[H+]`, where [H+] is the concentration of H+ ions in the solution.
